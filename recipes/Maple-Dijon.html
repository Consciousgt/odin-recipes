        <h3><strong>Description</strong>
            <p>This is my go-to unexpected side for Thanksgiving and other pot-lucks. 
                Aside from being gorgeous, it holds up well when made ahead, tastes great at room temp, and appeals to lots of eaters because it's vegan, paleo, gluten-free, and low-carb friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only thing that takes time is deconstructing the Brussels sprouts. 
                The salad keeps in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
            </p>
